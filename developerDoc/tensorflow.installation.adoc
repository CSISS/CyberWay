== Installing TensorFlow

=== Anaconda Environment

Create and activate the Anaconda virtual environment for TensorFlow:
----
conda create --name py354_tf python=3.5.4
source activate py354_tf
----

In this case, we use Python 3.5.4 as the base version of Python. The environment is located at: /home/geo2015/anaconda3/envs/py354_tf


=== Install TensorFlow

The url of the latest version of TensorFlow package could be accessed at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac#the_url_of_the_tensorflow_python_package.
Install TensorFlow with "pip install":
----
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.4.1-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
----


=== Verification

Verify the installation with the following Python code:
[source, python]
----
import tensorflow as tf
hello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')
sess = tf.Session()
print(sess.run(hello))
----

If TensorFlow is successfully installed, a message would be printed: "b'Hello, TensorFlow!'".
